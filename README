GStreamer DLL loader plugin:
============================

How to get this working:

* install a codecpack, e.g. the ones from the mplayer website
* install this
* run gst-register

gst-inspect pitfdll should show plugins, if all went well. Test pipelines:

gst-launch filesrc location=file.asf ! asfdemux .video_00 ! dmodec_wmv9dmod
   ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink (Windows Media Video 9)
gst-launch filesrc location=file.mov ! qtdemux .audio_00 ! qtadec_bin !
   audioconvert ! audioscale ! alsasink (QDesign Music 2)
gst-launch filesrc location=file.avi ! avidemux .video_00 ! dshowdec_ir50_32
   ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink (Intel Indeo Video 5.0)

Notes:
======
* I didn't do anything. Code is a direct cp -a from the Xine tree. I
   fail to understand even the smallest bits. Don't ask me questions,
   I will not know.
* Say thanks to the Xine team for the nice code.
* Threaded use fails completely, it'll crash on Check_FS_Segment():
ldt_keeper: FS segment is not set or has being lost!
            Please report this error to xine-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
            Aborting....
   I don't know what that means. Removing Check_FS_Segment() will cause
   segfaults on the first call to *_Decode(), so don't bother trying.

License:
========
Since it's based on Xine code, all this is GPL. The code in ext/pitfdll/
is original, self-written code, so the headers say LGPL. The end product,
however, is GPL until someone provides me a LGPL .dll loader.
